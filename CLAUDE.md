## Versioning Policy

This app follows semantic versioning. Baseline: 1.2.0 (Jun 2026)

Every commit must include a version bump:
- Bug fix, UI tweak, copy change, config fix → PATCH (x.x.+1)
  Run: npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
- New feature, new page, new API, new chart → MINOR (x.+1.0)
  Run: npm version minor --no-git-tag-version
- Breaking change, DB migration, architecture overhaul → MAJOR (+1.0.0)
  Run: npm version major --no-git-tag-version

Examples of what counts as each type:
- Login page overhaul → Minor
- New dashboard with charts → Minor
- Health score tracking → Minor
- Bug fix (hardcoded IP, broken link, wrong email) → Patch
- New EOL intelligence integration → Minor
- Schema breaking change → Major

Rules:
- ALWAYS bump version as part of the same commit as the changes
- NEVER skip the version bump
- Run npm version BEFORE npm run build
- The app reads version from package.json via /api/health
- NocVault suite itself has no version number — only the 4 apps
